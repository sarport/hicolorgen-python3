# Image resizer script
# Tomasz ZajÄ…c (c) 2016
# This uses a bash script file (resize.sh) that contains the instructions 
# for a GIMP script that will resize the picture and save it under a new name.
# Please don't judge my Python skills, it's not that simple as C++. See what I did there?
# UPDATE: Please do not use this script, the shell script or the Scheme script for GIMP.
# generate.py is written with OpenCV, works much faster and you don't need to execute shell scripts.
